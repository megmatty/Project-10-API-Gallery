# Project-10-API-Gallery
Treehouse Project 10
----
This is my tenth project for Treehouse Techdegree: Front End Developer.

**Project Notes:**
* Validated HTML, CSS
* Tested on a Mac with Safari 9.1.1 (11601.6.17), Chrome 51.0.2704.63, Firefox 46.0.1
* Attempted to hit exceeds criteria
  * Used 2 APIs - OMDB and Flickr to make 2 galleries on one page with a shared lightbox
  * Each gallery has its own sort buttons 

**Needs Work, Need to Learn, and Thoughts:**
* This project isn't as DRY as it should be. There is repetition in the functions. Ideally, if I had to start this again, I would
  create a single lightbox function and a microstructure for mapping the JSON data. Essentially, like creating a lightbox plugin for
  myself that was agnostic to what kind of data it was passed.
* I discovered that getting experience so that I learn to structure projects from the get go will be key - as a learner I can make 
  working bits of code, but it isn't yet optimal (repeating myself) or has trouble adapting once I have to add a feature (like navigation
  in the lightbox).
* On a more meta note, I am finding that I often know what needs to happen with code, or what structure it should have, but have 
  difficulty figuring out HOW to execute it. But compared to a few months ago, I can better identify what's needed and get something
  working. The next step will be refining my abilities to get not only working code, but DRY and reusable, adaptable code.

~Time to complete: 1 week for actual coding. Work demanded that I adapt my 2 week personal deadline by an extra weekend, so total project
  time including watching videos was 2 weeks, 4 days.
